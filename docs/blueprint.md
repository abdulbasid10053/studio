## Core Features:

- Next.js Conversion: Conversion of the current static HTML website into a dynamic, responsive web application using the Next.js framework.
- Component-Based Architecture: Restructuring the project using reusable React components for improved maintainability and scalability.
- Modern CSS Styling: Implementing modern CSS techniques and utility-first classes (like Tailwind CSS) for styling.
- Interactive Enhancements: Enhancing user experience with JavaScript for interactive elements.
- Loading Speed Tracking: Optimize the landing page with a loading speed detection tool which records performance over time.
- Intelligent Menu Suggestions: Implement a generative AI tool that suggests menu item pairings based on time of day, and the customer's location. If it's between 10pm and 2am, the bot will recommend an extra spicy dish. If it's past midnight it will include a sleep aid such as hot tea in the menu suggestions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep gold (#D4AF37), evoking a sense of warmth, quality, and tradition related to Indonesian cuisine and culinary heritage.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212), nearly black, creating contrast with content elements in the dark color scheme, but still matching the user request.
- Accent color: Soft amber (#E0B448), analogous to gold but with lower saturation, used to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action without overwhelming the primary gold.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use a set of simple, modern icons to represent the different food ordering platforms, and other sections such as social media and maps.
- Implement a grid-based layout system to ensure a consistent look and feel across different screen sizes.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance the user experience and provide feedback on interactions.
